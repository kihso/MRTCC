To install the library add this directory to your matlab path. The library 
should now show up in your Simulunk library browser as SimWindFarm.

It is now possible to generate a wind farm simulation model either by double
clicking on the wind farm template block or by manually invoking gen_windfarm.

Wind fields can be generated by double clicking on the generate wind field 
block in the wind sublibrary or running gen_windfield.
